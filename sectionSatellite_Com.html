In this chapter, we discussed AWS’s remarkable array of networking, IoT,
and satellite solutions that empower organizations to achieve
unparalleled levels of connectivity, data insights, and communication
capabilities. From building and securing virtual private clouds (Amazon
VPC) to orchestrating microservices with AWS App Mesh, AWS has emerged
as a transformative force in the cloud computing landscape [65]. The
integration of AWS Cloud Map simplifies service discovery, while AWS
Direct Connect and AWS Global Accelerator enhance connectivity and
global reach.
In IoT, AWS IoT Core serves as the foundation for secure and scalable
IoT applications, and AWS IoT FleetWise, AWS IoT SiteWise, and AWS IoT
TwinMaker offer powerful tools for managing and analyzing IoT data at
scale. Moreover, AWS IoT Greengrass extends AWS capabilities to edge
devices, enabling real-time processing and decision-making in IoT
deployments. The chapter highlighted AWS’ commitment to innovation with
services like AWS IoT 1-Click, AWS IoT Analytics, AWS IoT Button, and
AWS IoT Device Defender, all of which contribute to the seamless
integration and secure management of IoT ecosystems.
Furthermore, AWS’ satellite communication service, AWS Ground Station,
redefines how organizations interact with and extract data from
satellites, offering a highly accessible and cost-effective solution for
satellite communication. This chapter has demonstrated AWS’ dedication
to providing a comprehensive suite of services that address the evolving
needs of modern businesses, backed by scholarly insights into
networking, IoT, and satellite technology [66].
In conclusion, AWS’ Networking and Content Delivery, Internet of Things,
and Satellite services enable organizations to leverage the power of the
